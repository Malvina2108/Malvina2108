# Gallery Hunt
Gallery Hunt is developed using PHP, CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript.
This is a purely CSS based image gallery that display larger versions of
thumbnail images dynamically when the mouse hovers over them. A rich
HTML caption can be added to the enlarged image, and every aspect of the
image gallery exists as plain HTML on page. The idea is to use CSS's
":hover" pseudo class to cause an element to react onMouseover. When
that happens, an absolutely positioned container holding the enlarged
image, anchored on the page by another container with position set to
relative.
